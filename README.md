ABOUT ME
I am Lucian and started in February this year my journey of rediscovering programming.
I returned last year from the USA where I was invited 7 years ago to teach students with disabilities.
The life circumstances concurred in such a way exposing me to Python... 
... I loved it from the first time due to its simple syntax, its dynamic nature, and the ease of use.
During my training I came across frameworks like Django and Flask, libraries, and databases structures. 
I am currently improving my knowledge and skill continuously through diverse courses, tutorials, books, and cheat sheets.
