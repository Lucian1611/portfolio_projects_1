ABOUT ME
I am Lucian and started in Febuary this year my journy of rediscovering programming.
I returned last year from the USA where I was invited 7 years ago to teach students with disabilities.
The life circumstances concurred in such a way exposing me to Python... 
... I loved it from the first time due to its simple sintax, its dynamic nature, and the ease of use.
