My calculator app can be used as a quick desktop calculator for basic math operations

This calculator can be made executable following the steps below:

1. CREATE A FOLDER ON YOUR COMPUTER (PREFERABLY ON DESKTOP)
2. PUT THE calculator.py AND A CALCULATOR ICON OF YOUR CHOICE (DOWNLOAD FROM GOOGLE AN ICON (.ico) AND NAME IT calc)

IN Command Prompt/ PowerShell
3. INSTALL PYINSTALLER
pip install pyinstaller
4. CHANGE DIRECTORY POINTING TO YOUR DESKTOP FOLDER CONTAINING calculator (python file) and calc (ico file)
pyinstaller -F -w -i calc.ico calculator.py
                            where -F for all in one file;
                                  -w for removing terminal window
                                  -i calc.ico for adding a beautiful custom icon to .exe
                                  calculator.py is your python file
5. ON YOUR DESKTOP FOLDER, IN THE dist FOLDER YOU WILL HAVE THE calculator APP. DRAG IT TO YOUR DESKTOP AND
DELETE THE FOLDER USED FOR THE ABOVE PURPOSE... YOU DON'T NEED IT ANYMORE
6. ENJOY YOUR desktop calculator

POSSIBLE ISSUES:
"file not found"
Solution: make sure your python and icon files' name don't have extensions (.py and .ico) in the desktop folder

"pyinstaller is not recognized as an internal or external command"
Solution: adding directory to the path. Edit System Variables > Environment Variables > System Variables > New > add pyinstaller path
